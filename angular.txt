Why Angular?

‚úÖ 1. Complete Framework
Angular is a full-fledged framework, not just a library. It provides everything you need to build large-scale, enterprise-grade applications:

Routing

HTTP client

Form handling

State management

Dependency injection

Testing utilities

‚úÖ 2. Two-Way Data Binding
Angular offers two-way data binding, meaning the UI reflects model changes instantly and vice versa. This simplifies synchronization between your data and view.

‚úÖ 3. TypeScript-Based
Angular is built on TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that provides:

Static typing

Better tooling (auto-complete, refactoring)

Catching errors during development

‚úÖ 4. Component-Based Architecture
Angular uses a component-driven structure:

Encourages modular code

Easy to test, reuse, and maintain

Great for team collaboration

‚úÖ 5. CLI Support
The Angular CLI is powerful:

Generates components, services, routes, etc.

Handles builds, testing, and deployment

Reduces setup time significantly

‚úÖ 6. Enterprise-Ready
Angular is used by Google and other major companies, especially for large-scale, maintainable applications. It's highly suitable for long-term, enterprise-level development.

‚úÖ 7. Built-in Features
You get built-in support for:

HTTP communication

Forms (template-driven & reactive)

Routing and guards

Lazy loading for better performance

‚úÖ 8. Large Ecosystem & Community
Angular has a large developer community and ecosystem:

Tons of libraries and tools

Angular Material for UI components

Lots of tutorials, StackOverflow help, and corporate support

üßë‚Äçüíº When to Choose Angular
Use Angular when:

You're building a large, complex SPA (Single Page Application)

You need strong typing and scalability

You're working with teams and long-term projects

You want out-of-the-box solutions (instead of piecing together libraries like with React)
